<br /><br /><br />**Name:** Jake Steven McAndrew  
 **Student Number:** s3818850  
 **Email:** jake_mcandrew67@Hotmail.com  
 **Basic background:** My names Jake, I’m 22 years old and I’m from Sydney. I was born and Australia, but my family originally                       comes from Ireland and Scotland. I can only speak English, but I do know how to code with java pretty                         well.I like to spend my free time gaming and lifting weights. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />  
## Interest in IT

My interests in IT are mainly to do with software development, programming, and cyber security, I also spend some of my free time building computers and being the family tech support. Ever since I was a child, I’ve always had an interest in IT, I spent most of my time pulling apart random electronics, googling and learning about future technologies and playing video games. My love of programming actually comes from the movie The Matrix, After I saw it the first time, I knew I had to be exactly like Neo. I have many years’ experience building computers and about 7 months of java experience.

In the beginning of the year I decided I wanted to make programming/coding into a career, since I have only finished year 12 and have no formal qualifications, I knew I had to go for a bachelor degree. I spent months trying to find the best degree and university to suit my needs, I ultimately settled on RMIT after reading many positive reviews from past students. I also like that RMIT had the option to study online through OUA

I expect to learn to make myself employable so I can obtain my dream career as a software developer, I also would like to further my coding/programming skills through maybe learning a new programming language.

## Ideal job

This particular job fascinates me because I didn’t realise the government would want to hire someone to build, break or rebuild software. This job appeals to me because I love the idea of using my skills for a greater good like national protection instead of using them just to make a big corporation more money. This job is basically all about cyber security and protecting Australia, they also offer mentorship which is a huge plus for me.
